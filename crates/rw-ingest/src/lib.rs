//! Live GRIB -> `.rws` ingest as a library: the exact fetch/extract/derive/
//! write flow the `rw_ingest`/`rw_batch` bins have always run, extracted
//! from their `#[path]`-shared modules so interactive hosts (the
//! rusty-weather-ui shell) can run ingests in-process on background
//! threads with progress events and cancellation.
//!
//! Layout mirrors the old bin-side modules one-to-one:
//! - [`ingest_hour`] (re-exported at the crate root): per-hour
//!   [`fetch_hour`] / [`process_fetched_hour`] / [`ingest_hour()`],
//!   [`IngestConfig`], [`planned_store_variables`], [`parse_hours`].
//! - [`ingest_profile`]: what one run fetches/extracts/computes/stores
//!   (`full` / `sounding` / `view` presets + overrides + validation).
//! - [`ingest_compute`]: the derived/heavy precompute over the products
//!   decode lane.
//! - [`size_estimate`]: exact (`walk_hour_sizes`) and predictive
//!   (`estimate` against a [`size_estimate::Calibration`]) sizing.
//! - [`throttle`]: polite scheduling — the bins' process-wide knobs plus
//!   the per-thread / dedicated-pool variants for interactive hosts.
//! - [`events`] (re-exported at the crate root): [`IngestEvent`] progress
//!   stream, [`IngestStage`], [`IngestError`] (with a `Cancelled` variant),
//!   and [`print_event`] — the sink that reproduces the bins' historical
//!   stdout/stderr lines byte-for-byte.
